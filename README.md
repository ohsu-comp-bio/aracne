This repo contains simple CLI wrapper scripts and environment config (docker, conda) for [Aracne-AP](https://github.com/califano-lab/ARACNe-AP), which does "Network Reverse Engineering through AP inference of Mutual Information".

The [Aracne-AP docs](https://github.com/califano-lab/ARACNe-AP) have a great description of how to work with the Aracne command line.
